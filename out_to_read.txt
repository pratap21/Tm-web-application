Significance of HbAlc

Hemoglobin A Ic is the test that measures the amount of glycated hemoglobin in the RBC.HBA Ic ,the glycohemoglobin
of interest ,is formed by two steps by the non enzymatic glycation of HBA .The first step is the formation of unstable
aldimine (schif base) named LABILE Alc or preA1c,which is a reversible reaction between the carbonyl (C=O) group
of glucose and the N-terminal valine of beta chain of HbA.

hydroxycalciferol (25-OH-D). The first step in the metabolism of vitamin D, 25 hydroxylation, occurs mainly

in liver 1Only a small amount of 25-OH-D is metabolized in the kidney to other dihydroxyvitamin Dmetabolites
man. 2,3 Since 25-OH-D is the predominant circulating form of vitamin D in the normal population, it is concider
the most reliabe index of vitamin d status 4

The two principal forms of 25-OH-d are cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) and ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) 3,5 Vitamin
derived mainly from actions of ultraviolet light on the skin while D2 is derived solely from dietry sourses. Sin two
parent compounds provide various contributions to the overall vitamin D status of the individual, it is important that
both forms are measured equally. 6,7 A great deal of research has provided information about the circulation

of 25-OH-D metabolism and their physiological significance.

The measurment of 25-OH-D is becoming increasing importent in the management of patients with various disorders

of calcium metabolism associated with rickets, neonatal hypocalcemia, pregnancy, nutritional and osteodystrophy,
hypoparathyrodism, and postmenopausal oseoporosis.6,8-10/.

COMMENT: Consistently elevated serumprolactin levels greater than 30 ng/ml in the absebce of
pregnancy and postpartum lactation are indicative of hyperprolactinemia, which is the most common
hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction encountered in clinical endocrinology. Hyperprolactinemia often
results in galactorrhea, amenorrhea, and infertility in females, and in impotence and hypoganadism in
males. Renal faliure, hypoparathyrodism, and prolactine- secreting pituitary adenomas are also common
causes of abnormally elevated prolactin levels.

SERUM TRI-IODO THYROXINE (T3) 112 ng/dl 97.0 - 170.0

T 3 is a hormone produced primarily in the peripheral tissues like liver and kidneys from.
T4 by the monodeiodinase enzyme. Small amount of T3 is also produced by thyroid gland.
The blood levels of T3 are low in hypothyrodism and high in hyperthyrodism.

SERUM THYROXINE (T4) 10.0 ug/dl 5.50 - 11.0

T4 is the major hormone synthesized by the thyroid gland which is regulated by the TSH .
when released from the thyroid gland 99.96% is bound to proteins like tbg, prealbumin
and albumin. the bound hormone is termed as total T4. the blood levels of T4 are low in
hypothyrodism and high in hyperthyrodism.

SERUM TSH 9.59 ulU/ml 0.35 - 5.50
TSH is produced by the anterior pituitary gland and stimulate the secretion of T3 and T4.
measurement of tsh is used in the diagnosis of primary hypothroidism when there is
thyroid gland failure due to intrinsic disease. tsh levels are raised in primary hypothroidism
and are low in hyperthyroidism and secondary hypothyroidism .
